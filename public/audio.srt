00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,140
Here we are at Michael Freeman, programmer of pizza party, and we're going to do an example.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,540
So pizza party is command line software to order pizza.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,680
Why don't we take a look at the help on?

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,680
Okay, here we go.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,500
Here is the syntax of pizza party.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:18,840
Yep.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:19,640
Program.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,080
The options.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,820
How many pizzas?

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,900
What size and what kind of crust?

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,600
All right, so let's take a look at the flags.

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,520
Here is username password for your dominoes account.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,480
Input file, which allows you to order pizzas in batch if you're throwing a pizza party.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,880
Vervose, quiet, and force, our typical command line arguments.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,200
All right, standard Unix stuff.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,200
Standard Unix stuff.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,240
And here's some of the flags.

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,780
Onions, screen peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, pineapple.

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,600
Of course, if you haven't noticed yet, these are the toppings.

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,660
Cheddar cheese, pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon, ground beef, grilled chicken, anchovies, and extra sauce.

21
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,640
So why don't we order a pizza?

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,200
Here you go.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,040
What do you want on it?

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,720
Pepperoni?

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,680
Uh-huh.

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:06,900
Mushrooms?

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,740
Yep.

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,560
Anything else?

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,960
No, that's cool.

30
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,500
How many?

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,800
Just one.

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,560
Uh-huh.

33
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,040
What size?

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,140
Medium.

35
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,520
And what kind of crust?

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,140
Hmm, thin.

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,040
Thin crust.

38
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,880
Okay, here we go.

39
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,940
All right, so here's our confirmation.

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,560
1248 is your price.

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:25,960
Are you ready?

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,340
Yeah.

43
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,980
There you go.

44
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:28,700
All right.

45
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,980
And then it bumps us back to the command line.

46
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,060
You know, ready for fun stuff.

47
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,820
Yeah, so let's see what time it is.

48
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,960
All right, so 621.

49
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,080
So we'll see if the pizza comes in a half hour.

50
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,100
Oh, there we go.

51
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,980
See if the pizza comes in a half hour.

52
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,400
All right.

53
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:45,920
I'm hungry.

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,520
All right.

55
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,960
All right.

56
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:52,920
Hello.

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,800
There we go.

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,400
What do you guys want?

59
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,280
It comes to 1248.

60
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,660
Thank you.

61
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,540
How much more back to it, right?

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:00,960
1248.

63
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,920
Five up.

64
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,020
Oh, thin crust.

65
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,120
Oh, nice.

66
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,620
I never had.

67
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,740
Oh, wow.

68
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,340
Yeah, right?

69
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:07,820
It's good.

70
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:08,780
Yeah.
